### This repo will be archived and deleted soon. If you are interested, please check a new version at: https://github.com/xuanma/pyqt5_camera_new

### In the new repo, more USB cameras can be supported. The program works well with 2~3 USB cameras on laptops, depending on your computer settings. On desktops, more than 4 USB cameras can be streamed simultaneously, if there are as many as USB ports.
